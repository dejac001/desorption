History
=======
* MCCCS-MN source code was taken from https://github.com/SiepmannGroup/desorption on 6/3/2020.

Contributing
============
We are actively looking for contributors! A good way to get started is to check out the [Issues](https://github.com/MCCCS-X/MCCCS-X/issues), especially the ones labelled **Good First Issue**.

Road Map
========
We hope to add documentation and tests to the code in preparation for a NumFOCUS application (see [Project 2](https://github.com/MCCCS-X/MCCCS-X/projects/2)).
With the NumFOCUS application, we hope to further document algorithms, test, and optimize the code for a wide audience.
